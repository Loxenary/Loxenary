## 💫 About Me

I am a developer who approaches engineering with a **business-oriented mindset**, focusing on building systems that deliver clear value rather than code for its own sake.

That perspective was not my starting point. I began as a software engineer focused on writing the best code possible—clean, scalable, and technically sound. Quality was measured primarily by correctness and structure.

**Game development expanded that foundation.** Working with complex, evolving codebases sharpened my understanding of system architecture, iteration costs, and long-term maintainability under real constraints. I've led teams in national competitions (Gemastik, Gameseed) and built a fully functional action-roguelike in just 48 hours at the Garena Game Jam.

Over time, I realized that strong engineering alone is insufficient. Code that does not serve a product goal, user need, or production reality ultimately creates cost, not value. Since then, my decisions have shifted toward **prioritization, trade-offs, and impact**—balancing technical quality with time, resources, and outcomes.

**Today, I build with intent:** engineering choices are evaluated by the value they unlock.

**Currently working on:** *Laksha* - A horror game narrative game with a strong focus on storytelling.

<summary><b>🚀 What I'm Looking For & Learning</b></summary>
<br>

- 👯 **Seeking Collaboration:** Projects where engineering serves clear product vision—indie games with strong design goals or VR/XR experiences solving real user problems

- 🌱 **Currently Expanding:** Unity system architecture patterns, game UI development, and AI-driven behaviors that deliver gameplay value without over-engineering

- 🤝 **Growth Areas:** Advanced shader programming and AI/ML for NPC systems—balancing quality with maintainability and iteration speed

- 💬 **Happy to Discuss:** Unity architecture trade-offs, scaling game systems under constraints, leading technical teams, or evaluating features by user impact over technical novelty
